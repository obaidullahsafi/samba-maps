git colne the link ----

but first we have to go to srv 
by following commond 
cd /srv
and we will create share folder 
mkdir shares
in share we will create others folders
like dtp, varia, projecten, media, public,training,locaties
after we we will go to dtp
by following commond
cd dtp
and there we will link all others folders by following commond
ln -s /srv/shares/varia
ln -s /srv/shares/projecten
ln -s /srv/shares/media
ln -s /srv/shares/locaties
ln -s /srv/shares/training
ln -s /srv/shares/intern
ln -s /srv/shares/public
if you now use ls commond you will see all the maps there in dtp
after if you open your shares folders in windows 
only patrick will be able to acces dtp map and all submaps
and he can write ,read , excute the maps 
whatever he does there will be aviabel for other users.
